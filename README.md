# Drawing Bot
This repository contains the source code for the Drawing Bot project, a 2-D plotter used to mimic human drawing/lettering. This project was created by Tamkin Rahman and Patrick Sarimento for the final project of ECE 4180. Unauthorized commercial use is strictly prohibited.

The project is broken up into 2 pieces of software:
1. Embedded side, used to control the stepper motors and servo motor with an Adafruit Motor Shield V1 (Arduino Uno). 
2. PC side, used to allow users to draw on a digital canvas, and then send commands to the Arduino Uno to move the pen to the required points to draw the image.
